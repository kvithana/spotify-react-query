# Spotify React Query

[![Latest][latest-img]](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-react-query)
[![Size][size-img]](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=spotify-react-query)

Simple React Query hooks for the Spotify Web API. With the power of [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/quick-start), requests for Spotify resources are automatically cached, and by leveraging [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) under the hood, we can batch calls for similar resources to avoid using up your Spotify API quota.

This package is used by musictaste.space.

> ðŸš¨ This package is currently not ready for production and the API has not been finalized.

## Install

Install this package by running the following command in your project:

```
yarn add spotify-react-query
```

## Usage

In order to use the hooks, you must wrap dependent components in a `SpotifyQueryProvider` and pass in a [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/quick-start) `QueryClient`. The client can be customized to suit your use case, or you can pass in the default client and it will work out of the box.

You must also provide a Spotify Client instance from `spotify-web-api-node`. The library will not perform any requests until an access token is set on the client. You will need to manage the lifecycle of token refreshes outside of `<SpotifyQueryProvider>` context.

### SpotifyQueryProvider

```typescript
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query"
import SpotifyClient from "spotify-web-api-node"

const query = new QueryClient()
const spotify = new SpotifyClient()
// this is usually managed inside your application
spotify.setAccessToken("<ACCESS_TOKEN>")

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SpotifyQueryProvider query={query} spotify={spotify}>
      <DependentComponents />
    </SpotifyQueryProvider>
  )
}
```

### Quickstart Example

```typescript
import { useSimplifiedTrack } from "spotify-react-query"

function TrackComponent({ uri }: { uri: string }) {
  const { data: track, isLoading } = useSimplifiedTrack(uri)

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (!track) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {track.name} by ${track.artists[0].name}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Simplified and Full Entities

For many Spotify API entities, there are two subtypes which are returned depending on your query - `simplified` and `full`. Please refer to the Spotify API documentation to differentiate between the two given the entity. In the majority of cases, the simplified result may be enough.

Under the hood, when a query fetches simplified data about related entities (eg. when you query for an album and it returns simplified artist and album tracks), the library will prime the cache with those entities. This means that if you first used the `useFullAlbum` hook to fetch an album, and then use a component leveraging the `useSimplifiedTrack` hook to render the tracks based on the album track URIs, **the data will already be in the cache and an additional network request will not be made**.

For this reason, it's recommended that you use the simplified entities wherever possible.

### Hooks

#### Tracks

```typescript
function useSimplifiedTrack(id: string, options?: ReactQueryOptions)
```

```typescript
function useFullTrack(id: string, options?: ReactQueryOptions)
```

#### Albums

```typescript
function useSimplifiedAlbum(id: string, options?: ReactQueryOptions)
```

```typescript
function useFullAlbum(id: string, options?: ReactQueryOptions)
```

#### Artists

```typescript
function useSimplifiedArtist(id: string, options?: ReactQueryOptions)
```

```typescript
function useFullArtist(id: string, options?: ReactQueryOptions)
```

#### Playlists

```typescript
function usePlaylist(id: string, options?: ReactQueryOptions)
```

```typescript
function usePlaylistTracks({
  variables?: { id: string; fields?: string; limit?: number; offset?: number; market?: string } },
  options?: ReactQueryOptions
)
```

#### Statistics

```typescript
function useUserTopTracks(
  variables: { limit?: number; offset?: number; time_range: "short_term" | "medium_term" | "long_term" },
  options?: ReactQueryOptions
)
```

```typescript
function useUserTopArtists(
  variables: { limit?: number; offset?: number; time_range: "short_term" | "medium_term" | "long_term" },
  options?: ReactQueryOptions
)
```

```typescript
function useRecentlyPlayedTracks(
  variables: { after?: number; before?: number; limit?: number },
  options?: ReactQueryOptions
)
```

### Spotify Client

You can also use the Spotify client directly to leverage all the methods available via `spotify-web-api-node`

```typescript
import { useSpotifyClient } from "spotify-react-query"

const client = useSpotifyClient()

client.getMe().then((res) => console.log(res.body))
```
